Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB

This Toolbox provides many functions that are useful in robotics including such things as Twists, Kinematics, Manipulator forward Dynamics, and Manipulator Jacobian. The Toolbox is useful for simulation as well as analyzing results from experiments with real robots.

The Toolbox is provided for the book “An Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulator” (preprint, 3, Jan 1994) by Richard M.Murray, Zexiang Li and S.Shankar Sastry. Many problems in the book about homogenous transformation, twists, and kinematics can be solved by this Toolbox, and some example codes are provided. Most functions in the toolbox support symbol computation.

The Toolbox works with MATLAB version 6.5 and has been tested on a Windows XP.I don’t know whether the Toolbox can work well under the older versions or other platforms.
